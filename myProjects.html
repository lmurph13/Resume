        <li><strong>C Programmer, Independent Project</strong> | Binghamton, NY
            <ul>
               <li> Programmed a method of converting decimal numbers into IEEE floating point numbers</li>
               <li>Implemented a method of using Bit Manipulation to make the conversion, managed with the GitHub Version Control System</li>
               <li> Successfully converted decimal numbers to arbitrarily sized IEEE floating point numbers </li> 
            </ul>

        </li>
        <li><strong>Java Programmer, Independent Project</strong> | Binghamton, NY
            <ul>
                <li>Programmed a method of searching and sorting input text files with a GUI </li>
                <li>Assembled the data with selection sort, measured the run time of adding and searching the data to linear and non-linear data structures</li>
            </ul>

        </li>
        <li><strong>C/x86 Programmer, Independent Project</strong> | Binghamton, NY
            <ul>
                <li>Performed a simulated buffer overflow attack on a C program to change the data being entered into an array without being detected </li>
                <li>Programmed a script in x86 that would overflow the buffer of a target function, change the data, and then return to the next function</li>
                 <li>Successfully altered the program to change the data without detection</li>   
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>x86/GDB Programmer, Independent Project</strong> | Binghamton, NY
            <ul>
                <li>Successfully diffused the Binary Bomb by completing a series of puzzles hidden in the x86 code </li>
                <li>Operated the GDB debugger to step through the disassembled program to figure out how to pass the different phases</li>
                <li> Completed the project without blowing up the Binary Bomb </li>
            </ul>

        </li>
        <li><strong>Python Programmer, Independent Project</strong> | Binghamton, NY
            <ul>
                <li> Programmed a method of extracting data from different JSON files using APIs that sent an email with the current number of covid cases</li>
                <li> Accessed data stored in JSON files using different APIs then sent the email using pythons mailer library</li>
                <li> Presented the final result of the project to a class of 50 people</li>
            </ul>

        <li><strong>Python Programmer, Team Member</strong> | Binghamton, NY
            <ul>
                <li>Programmed a playable space invader spin-off game using the python Pygame library </li>
                <li>Managed the front-end and back-end of the program making sure everything worked together</li>
                <li>Presented a demo of the game to a class of 50 people</li>
            </ul>
